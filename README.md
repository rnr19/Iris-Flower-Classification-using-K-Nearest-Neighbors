# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—using the well-known Iris dataset. The classification model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple and effective machine learning technique. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on the length and width of its sepals and petals.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with four features each:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample is labeled with one of the three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Project Structure

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, and it includes the following steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution of features

3. **Model Training:**
   - Training the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier on the training data

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Predicting the species on the test data
   - Calculating the accuracy of the model

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn



## Results

The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of **100%** on the test data, demonstrating its effectiveness for this classification task.

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on example of using the KNN algorithm for a simple classification problem. The Iris dataset, with its clean and well-defined features, serves as an excellent starting point for learning machine learning techniques.
